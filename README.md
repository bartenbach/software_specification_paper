# software_specification_paper
This is my research paper for graduate course Software Specification and Design at UNO.

The project must be done in LaTex, and this is my first time using it, so it has been a learning experience.

*Note: at the time of this writing, this is largely a work in progress*

# topic
The topic of this research paper is Distributed Cognition and whether or not it can be easily applied (relatively) to Agile software teams in a consistent and repeatable manner.
