Prioritizing user stories can be a cognitively challenging and draining due to the differing perspectives, technical backgrounds, and domain knowledge of individuals involved. This is furthermore complicated by the lack of an objective prioritization methodology or framework to support the process. This paper aims to identify the state of new research in the field of Distributed Cognition and whether or not it can be applied to common Agile processes for enhanced effectiveness. We summarize three papers concerning the origin of Distributed Cognition, the development of a framework to apply Distributed Cognition Theory to enhance work performed in teams, and most importantly, the application of this framework to a real-world Agile requirements prioritization setting. We find that the research in the area is sparse, and that much more research is needed. However, new studies have begun to show promising applications of this framework to Agile team settings.
