# Research Question: Can the research done to apply principles of Distributed Cognition to Teams be applied to Agile projects in a concise and repeatable manner to simplify Agile Requirements Prioritization.

1. Is Distributed Cognition valuable as a concept?
   > The original proposal was rather unscientific, but more recent experiments have shown value in these concepts.

2. Is Distributed Cognition applicable to teams?
   > Yes. Early research was inconclusive, but recent experiments leveraging the DiCoT framework for applying the principles of Distributed Cognition to Teams have shown value in real-world settings.

3. Is Distributed Cognition applicable to Agile Requirements Prioritization?
   > Research is very limited, but an experiment applying the DiCoT framework to an Agile team's Requirement Prioritization has produced a wealth of valuable information.

# Conclusion

Although the research for DC is still young, sparse, and sometimes misleading, more recent research has proven it's worth by providing Agile teams with a wealth of knowledge. It is not possible to say at this time whether this can be distilled into a simple, repeatable formula that can be generically applied to any team, as there is simply not enough research. However, a list of this simple criteria has been identified, and is ready for real-world testing.
