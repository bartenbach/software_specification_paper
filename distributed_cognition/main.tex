\section{Problem}
The paper aims to understand cognition beyond the traditional sense in which we talk about a single individual's "skin or skull," as they word it. Distributed Cognition aims to understand cognition that is distributed among individuals in groups. More specifically, the aim of the author is to understand how tasks which are currently done by a single individual could be distributed to a group.

\section{Proposed Solution}
The paper does not necessarily propose any solutions. The goal of the paper appears to be to educate the reader about distributed cognition and convince the reader that it is important enough to warrant continued investigation.
